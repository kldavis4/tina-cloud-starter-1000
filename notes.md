# TLDR
- Need docs on how to use pagination / example (could also add it to the starter)

# Added 200 authors and 2k blog posts

## Initial impressions
- list in app page got very large (could hardly load)
- admin (CMS) is slow (in local)
- admin (CMS) has no pagination
- admin (CMS) has no sort

## Need to add pagination to the blog page

- Docs where not helpful

(attach two screenshots)


Luckily I can get by without docs
